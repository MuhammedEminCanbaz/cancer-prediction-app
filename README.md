# Cancer Prediction with Streamlit

This project was created by building a cancer prediction model using Linear Regression and turning it into a Web Application with the help of the Streamlit Library.

## Installation
* First, download the Project
* Install the necessary libraries
* Run with the command "Streamlit run app/main.py"

## Usage
The use of the project has been kept very simple and a user-friendly interface has been designed. By using the SideBar on the left, the values that a patient may have can be changed and at the same time, the graph on the screen is displayed with these values. At the same time, the model is working on the changing values and instantly calculates and shows the result.

## Model Description

The model used is the linear regression model. Although it was created with a small data set, a productive model was formed due to the regularity and usability of the data.
The reason for creating the model and converting it into a Web Application is due to my learning process and making projects to improve myself. In addition, it has a practical example for other people in the learning process,
It can be an important example in terms of both the model creation and export and import process of these models, general python use, and easily creating a web application with the Streamlit library.

## Additions
I expect feedback and comments from those who have the opportunity to review the project.
